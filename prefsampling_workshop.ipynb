You can think of this space as describing two underlying political or ideological dimensions, although the axes do not need to have a fixed interpretation. Each voter has an ideal point, and each candidate also has a position in the same space. <br> <br>\n",

In other words, voters prefer candidates whose positions are most similar to their own.
